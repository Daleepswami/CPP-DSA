What is an Operator?
    Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables or values.

Types of Operators::=>
01.Arithmetic Operators::=>>
    +     addition
    -     subtraction
    *     multiplication
    /     division
    %     modulus
  Ex.  int a = 10, b = 3;
       cout << a + b;
       cout << a - b;
       cout << a * b;
       cout << a / b;
       cout << a % b;
02.Assignment Operators::=>
     =   +=   -=   *=   /=   %=
   Ex.  int x = 5;
        x += 2;   
        x -= 5;
        x *= 15;
        x /= 25;
        x %= 12;

03. Relational Operators::=>
    ==   !=   >   <   >=   <=
       ==  Equal to
       !=  Not Equal to
       >   Greater than
       <   less than
       >= Greater than or equal to 
       <= less than or equal to
04.Logical Operators::=>
    &&   ||   !
         && =>>  AND operator
         || =>>  OR operator 
         !   =>> NOT operator

05. Increment / Decrement::=>>
     01.Increment::=>>
         01.01. post Increment::=>.
            Ex.   X++;
         01.02. pre Increment::=>>
            Ex.   ++X;
     02.Decrement::=>>
         02.01. post Decrement::=>>
            Ex.  X--;
         02.02. pre Decrement::=>>
            Ex.  ++X;
